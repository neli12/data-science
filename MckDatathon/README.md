Hello everyone!  
In this example, I will present my experience participating in the Datathon WomanHack promoted by the QuantumBlack, a company from McKinsey.  
I confess that at first, I felt nervous because I didn't have so much experience in Python programming and this was my first datathon. Nevertheless, at that time I wanted to participate to gain experience on how a hackaton, or in this case, a datathon works.  
The first step was to register for the event and then, the organizing commitee provided access to an app, where we were able to connect with other woman and to form the groups. I match with two incredible girls: Luc√≠a and Angy, from Argentina and Colombia, respectively. Both of them are already working as Data Scientist.  
In the first day, we were introduced each other and the organizers presented the challenge, which consisted of creating a model to predict the probability that a client will visit a store in the next 7 days, assuming that no communication is sent. The description of the challenge can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/marketcohackaton/overview/description.  

Basically, the dataset has nine columns (see figure below), with 10664209 observations representing the date of the purchase, purchase and client ID, category and item code, the quantity sold, price and cost.

From this dataset, new features needed to be created to be able to build and run the model.  
As a group, we decided to obtain

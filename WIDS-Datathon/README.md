## WIDS Datathon 2022
Hello everyone!  
I am participating (again) in a Datathon! In this new project, I will try to solve the challenge proposed by the Woman in Data Science Comunity (WIDS). This community born at the Stanford University and there are ambassador for all over the world. More details about this community can be found here: https://www.widsconference.org/
The challenge consists in "analyze differences in building energy efficiency and creating models to predict building energy consumption. All the articipants will use a dataset consisting of variables that describe building characteristics and climate and weather variables for the regions in which the buildings are located. Accurate predictions of energy consumption can help policymakers target retrofitting efforts to maximize emissions reductions." 
The description of the challenge can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2022/overview

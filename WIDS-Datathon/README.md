## WIDS Datathon 2022
Hello everyone!  
In January, the Woman in Data Science Community launched the WIDS Datathon 2022. The challenge consisted in "analyzing the differences in building energy efficiency and creating models to predict building energy consumption". For this, the committee make available a dataset consisting of variables that describe building characteristics and climate and weather variables for the regions in which the buildings are located. The main aim was to obtain accurate predictions of energy consumption. This information will help policymakers target retrofitting efforts to maximize emissions reductions.  
The Woman in Data Science Comunity (WIDS) born at the Stanford University and there are ambassador for all over the world. More details about this community can be found here: https://www.widsconference.org/

I this competition I participated alone, by myself, without a group. And here, I am presenting my solution to the proposed challenge.
